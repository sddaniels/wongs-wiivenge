				<h3>How to Set Up Wong's Wiivenge</h3>
				
				<p>We developed the project using the free Eclipse IDE. Unfortunately
				   we haven't been able to get the project to run outside of Eclipse
				   becuase of problems setting the classpath and linking to the native
				   libraries necessary to use OpenGL with Java. So if you would like
				   to run the project, the best way is to download the program from
				   Eclipse.org. No installation is necessary, and it should run as
				   long as you have the correct version of Java from java.sun.com.</p>
				   
				<p>Once Eclipse is unzipped, follow these directions:</p>
				
				<ol>
					<li>Run Eclipse.</li>
					<li>When the popup dialog asks where you would like to place your
					    workspace, select any directory you wish to work from.</li>
					<li>Go to File -> New and select Project.</li>
					<li>Select "Java Project" and click Next.</li>
					<li>Name the project anything you like and click Finish.</li>
					<li>The project you created should appear in the Package Expolorer
					    window on the left side of the screen. Right click on the project
					    icon and select Import.</li>
					<li>Select "File System" and click Next.</li>
					<li>Click Browse on the right side of the dialog.</li>
					<li>Select the directory where you unzipped the contents of this
					    final project.</li>
					<li>Click the + icon or the arrow next to the folder to expand the
					    contents of the folder.</li>
					<li>Click on the check boxes next to "client", "game_engine", and
					    "sockets". This will select all of the contents of these folders
					    for import.</li>
					<li>Click Finish. The necessary source files should now appear under
					    the project in the Package Explorer.</li>
					<li>Right click on the project icon again and select Properties.</li>
					<li>Click on "Java Build Path".</li>
					<li>Select the Libraries tab.</li>
					<li>Click the "Add External Jars" button.</li>
					<li>Again go to the directory where you unzipped the contents of this
					    final project. If you're running Windows, go into the "jogl windows"
					    folder. If you're running Mac OSX, go into the "jogl mac osx" folder.
					    Select "jogl.jar" and click Open.</li>
					<li>Click the + icon or the arrow next to jogl.jar to expand its properties.</li>
					<li>Select "Native library location".</li>
					<li>Click the Edit button.</li>
					<li>Click the External Folder button.</li>
					<li>Go back to the directory you selected that contains jogl.jar and click
					    Choose.</li>
					<li>Click the OK button.</li>
					<li>Click the OK button to close the project properties window.</li>
					<li>Go to the Run menu and select "Run...".</li>
					<li>Select "Java Application" and click the new button which looks
					    like a page with a + symbol on the upper right.</li>
				    <li>Give the configuration a name like "GameServer".</li>
				    <li>Click the Search button under "Main class:".</li>
				    <li>Double click GameServer.</li>
				    <li>Click the Run button to run the game's server.</li>
				    <li>Follow the same procedure again, but use the name GameClient and
				        select GameClient instead of GameServer after clicking Search.</li>
				    <li>You should now be able to run both the server and the client from
				        the drop down menu of the Run button in the toolbar, which looks like
				        a green circle with a white arrow in it.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>How to Run the Game</h3>
				
				<ol>
					<li>You need at least two computers with public IP addresses or connected on a LAN
					    subnet to play the game.</li>
					<li>Start the game server on one of the computers. You may enter a new port for
					    incoming connections or just hit enter to use the default. The game server
					    should now wait for connections from clients.</li>
					<li>If you want to use a Wiimote with the game (Mac only), start the modified
					    Darwiin program on each client computer. This is contained in the darwiin
					    folder. Hold down the 1 and 2 buttons simultaneously to connect the remote.
					    Note: A compatible Bluetooth adapter is required to connect a Wiimote.</li>
					<li>Start the game client on each computer. If the client is running on the
					    same computer as the server, leave the game server address at the default.
					    If it is running on another computer, type in the address of the computer
					    running the server (the server should print this to output when it's started.</li>
					<li>Make sure the correct port is listed and the frame rate is set to 60.</li>
					<li>Click "Connect to Server".</li>
					<li>You should now be able play the game.</li>
				</ol>
				
				<h3>How to Play the Game</h3>
				
				<p>The objective is to defeat your opponent by draining their health to zero. The
